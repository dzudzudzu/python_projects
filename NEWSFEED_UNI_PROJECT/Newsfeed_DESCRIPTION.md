### NEWSFEED Problem - Description

This one, was an UNI project, where we had to sort the newsfeed from most recent one onwards. 
Problem consisted of many subproblems to solve, and python code was just one of them, rest were: to write appropriate pseudocode
to analyze time complexity of our code, to prove correctness of the code, and to describe everything thoroughly. 
We weren't allowed to use any sort functions in python, which meant that we had to write algorithm ourselves.
